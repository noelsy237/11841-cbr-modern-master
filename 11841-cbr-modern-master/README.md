# 11841 Canberra Modern Website

https://noel.app.mickit.net/

The task was to develop a site using a front-end framework of my choice and using content provided via API calls.

## The Development Process
Using the template provided, I was able to figure out how to manipulate the content provided from the JSON files, and turn it into a presentable website. I began by creating all the pages that would be required. Next I added a bootstrap navbar for navigation between the pages. Then I added relevant content to each of the pages. Then I styled it all including formatting, colours and fonts.

## Design Decisions
- The various colours used throughout the site are directly from the colour scheme provided by Canberra Modern. I tried to use them sparingly though to keep a more simplistic style for the site.

- The fonts used for the navigation and headings are all sans-serif, whereas all paragraphs in the body are serif. This makes navigation of the site simple and easy while still keeping the font of the body stylish.

- The content is centered and the width is limited to 700px. This makes the pages more visually appealing and was easy to apply.

- Image sizes are limited and scale down in proportion to the device size.

## Examples of other sites
Most of the inspiration for the design of this site comes from the other architectural-related sites found within the links section of the Canberra Modern site. These sites include:
